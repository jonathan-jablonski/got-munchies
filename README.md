# Got Munchies?

As a HUNGRY CONSUMER,

I would like to FIND a restaurant that suits my requirements for distance, dietary restrictions, and/or craved style of food.

SO THAT I can decide what to eat while broadening my horizons on local restaurants.


# ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA

WHEN the user reaches the homepage

THEN they should be presented with several input options for what kind of food I'm feeling.

WHEN the user fills out the form with desired city, mile radius, and ordering method (delivery, takeout, dine-in)

THEN they will be presented with a restaurant that fits the criteria I filled out in a modal.

WHEN the modal loads

THEN the user should see the restaurant name, address, and map of the surrounding area.

WHEN the user wants to be given a restaurant at random

THEN they should click the 'Random' button to activate the modal.

WHEN the user clicks the random button

THEN they will be presented with a random restaurant, its address, and surrounding map of the area.
